# Tests

This directory contains simple tests for particular (sub)circuit(s). Tests are used for lightweight validation or functional view of basic models.

## PLS of CMOS Models
Circuit models used for PLS of CMOS are exercised in tests 001 - 007.

For details, see referenced papers [1], [2] and [3].

## Basic Standard Cell Simulation
Basic standard cell simulation files are provided: test 007 - 013.

## TSMC180nm Subthreshold Leakage Model
The [TSMC180nm Subthreshold Leakage Model](output/test014_model.pdf) in GNUplot for NMOS transistor with 0.2u x 2.0u channel is provided.

The ngSPICE simulation [file](test014_nmosSubthresholdLeakage.spice) is also available.
